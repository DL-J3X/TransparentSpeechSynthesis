# TransparentSpeechSynthesis

Code and associated files for transparent speech synthesis.

The goal of this project is to develop a speech synthesis system that is both clear and obviously synthetic. Our approach uses a novel approach – cocktail speaker decoding – for synthesis.

Please check back soon for a link to the code, results, and final paper.
